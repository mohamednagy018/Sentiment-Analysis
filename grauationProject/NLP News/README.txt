  - reviews.tsv: a tab separated file containing the "cleaned up" reviews. 
                     It contains over 63,000 reviews. The format is:
                     
                     rating<TAB>review id<TAB>user id<TAB>book id<TAB>review
                     
                     where:
                     
                     rating: the user rating on a scale of 1 to 5
                     review id: the goodreads.com review id
                     user id: the goodreads.com user id
                     book id: the goodreads.com book id
                     review: the text of the review
  
  - 2class-balanced-train/test.txt: text file containing indices of reviews 
                     (from the reviews.tsv file) that are in the training/test
                     sets. Balanced means the number of reviews in the 
                     positive/negative classes are equal. The ratings are 
                     converted into positive (rating 4 & 5) and negative 
                     (rating 1 & 2) and rating 3 is ignored.
                     
  - 2class-unbalanced-train/test.txt: the same, but the sizes of the calsses 
                     are not equal.
                     
  - 5class-balanced/unbalanced-train/test.txt: the same, but for 5 classes 
                     instead of just 2.
